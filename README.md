<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ <br> I'm Cirilo, a Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in JavaScript and PHP.
I love turning ideas into real-world applications and making the web a better place one project at a time. <br> <br>
I work mainly with Vue.js on the frontend and Laravel on the backend, always aiming for clean, readable code. <br> <br>
When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new tech trends or learning something new. ðŸš€ <br> <br>
Feel free to check out my projects and reach out â€” I'm always up for collaborating!
